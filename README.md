- [`MyFirstNotebook.ipynb`](https://github.com/nachoad/WDP-Quick-Start/blob/master/python/MyFirstNotebook.ipynb): Here you can see the notebook **you have to obtain**. *ipynb* is the Jupyter notebook format.  
- [`MyFirstNotebook-in-plain-text.py`](https://github.com/nachoad/WDP-Quick-Start/blob/master/python/MyFirstNotebook-plain.py): In plain text is easy to copy/paste code and text.
