### Exercise
My Fisrt Notebook: A simple example to get started with the notebooks on DSX.

The goal is to create a new notebook from scratch and add the following cells.

1. On DSX (datascience.ibm.com), go to Projects.
2. Click on create a new notebook.
3. Write the name "MyFirstNotebook".
4. Write a short description.
5. Select `Python 2.7` as language, and `Spark 2.0`.
6. Click on create button.
7. Open the next `ipynb` to see the final notebook you should have to obtain.
8. For help, see the plain text file.



- [`MyFirstNotebook.ipynb`](https://github.com/nachoad/WDP-Quick-Start/blob/master/python/MyFirstNotebook.ipynb): Here you can see the notebook **you have to obtain**. *ipynb* is the Jupyter notebook format.  
- [`MyFirstNotebook-in-plain-text.py`](https://github.com/nachoad/WDP-Quick-Start/blob/master/python/MyFirstNotebook-plain.py): In plain text is easy to copy/paste code and text.
