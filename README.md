# WDP Quick Start guide + DSX Hands-on

## Watson Data Platform (WDP) is an integrated platform of tools, services and data that helps companies accelerate their shift to become data-driven organizations.

For more information, please visit [the official page](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/watson-data-platform/platform.html) of **Watson Data Platform**, or contact to an IBM salesperson.

# Disclaimer
_The purpose of this document is to have a quick start guide on the platform. More specifically, this guide focuses on a user experience of WDP: Data Science Experience (DSX). Keep in mind that this guide does not cover all the features, it's just an introduction._

_This is not an official guide._

# Data Science Experience
### Intro to Data Science Experience (DSX)
IBM Data Science Experience is an integrated development environment offering a suite of tools and capabilities that enable **data scientists** to accelerate their **productivity**.

DSX allows to analyze data using RStudio and Jupyter notebooks in a configured, collaborative environment that includes IBM value-adds, such as managed Spark. RStudio is integrated in the offering and provides a development environment for working with R.
DSX provides Jupyter notebooks which are a web-based environment for interactive computing.

_Solve your toughest data challenges with the best tools and the latest expertise in a social environment built by data scientists._

- **Community**: Harness the power of the community. Check out the shared data sets, notebooks, and articles in our growing set of resources
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Create and collaborate on Python, R, and Scala notebooks that contain code and visualizations.
- **RStudio**: Jumpstart your R experience with a free, open-source RStudio tool.
- **Machine Learning** (Coming Soon): Create, train and deploy machine learning models.

### Exercise
My First Notebook: A simple example to get started with the notebooks on DSX.

The goal is to create a new notebook from scratch and add the following cells.

1. On DSX (datascience.ibm.com), go to Projects.
2. Click on create a new notebook.
3. Write the name "MyFirstNotebook".
4. Write a short description.
5. Select `Python 2.7` as language, and `Spark 2.0`.
6. Click on create button.
7. Open the next `ipynb` to see the final notebook you should have to obtain.
8. For help, see the plain text file.



- [`MyFirstNotebook.ipynb`](https://github.com/nachoad/WDP-Quick-Start/blob/master/python/MyFirstNotebook.ipynb): Here you can see the notebook **you have to obtain**. *ipynb* is the Jupyter notebook format.  
- [`MyFirstNotebook-in-plain-text.py`](https://github.com/nachoad/WDP-Quick-Start/blob/master/python/MyFirstNotebook-plain.py): In plain text is easy to copy/paste code and text.


# Data
- The `cars.csv` file contained on the /data folder, is a common file example in R (called as mtcars.csv). Has been downloaded from: https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html

- The `UNdata_population_total.csv` file contained on the /data folder has been downloaded from:
